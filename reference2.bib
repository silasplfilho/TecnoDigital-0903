The Relevance Cycle inputs requirements from the contextual envi- ronment into the research and introduces the research artifacts into environ- mental field testing. The Rigor Cycle provides grounding theories and methods along with domain experience and expertise from the foundations knowledge base into the research and adds the new knowledge generated by the research to the growing knowledge base. The central Design Cycle sup- ports a tighter loop of research activity for the construction and evaluation of design artifacts and processes. The recognition of these three cycles in a research project clearly positions and differentiates design science from other research paradigms. The commentary concludes with a claim to the pragmatic nature of design science.},

	abstract     = {More than 350 million people worldwide suffer from depression. Major depressive disorder has a hugely negative impact on psychological well-being, work, and family life. Yet culture may shape how depressed patients interpret their symptoms, choose treatments, and behave. This paper reports a case study, including participant observations and interviews, of the Chinese online depression community, SunForum. Our findings reveal that Chinese cultural beliefs (e.g., the power of inner self-control) and Chinese beliefs about traditional medicine (e.g., the integrated body-mind relationship) significantly affect patients' understandings of depression, illness management, and social interactions. These beliefs create problems of understanding depression in society-including family members, friends, co-workers, and others-and present various challenges for depressed patients who can become marginalized, suffer discrimination, and lose their jobs. We draw implications for how Chinese society as a whole may respond to the misunderstanding of mental illness and the raising of public awareness. We also propose specific social media design to support depressed patients as they seek online information and social support.

	abstract     = {Health outcomes in modern society are often shaped by peer in-teractions. Increasingly, a significant fraction of such interactions happen online and can have an impact on various mental health and behavioral health outcomes. Guided by appropriate social and psychological research, we conduct an observational study to under-stand the interactions between clinically depressed users and their ego-network when contrasted with a differential control group of normal users and their ego-network. Specifically, we examine if one can identify relevant linguistic and emotional signals from social media exchanges to detect symptomatic cues of depression. We ob-serve significant deviations in the behavior of depressed users from the control group. Reduced and nocturnal online activity patterns, reduced active and passive network participation, increase in nega-tive sentiment or emotion, distinct linguistic styles (e.g. self-focused pronoun usage), highly clustered and tightly-knit neighborhood structure, and little to no exchange of influence between depressed users and their ego-network over time are some of the observed characteristics. Based on our observations, we then describe an approach to extract relevant features and show that building a clas-sifier to predict depression based on such features can achieve an F-score of 90%.},
